# NASA Turbofan Failure Prediction

This project builds a series of machine learning models to predict the onset of failure in terms of remaining engine cycles for simulated turbofan data from NASA. 

Models from sklearn, TensorFlow (Keras) and PyTorch are trained on equivalent data sets and compared for performance and accuracy.

Training data is sourced from the NASA Prognostics Center Data Repository: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan
