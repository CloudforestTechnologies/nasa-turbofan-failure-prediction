# NASA Turbofan Failure Prediction

This data analytics / machine learning project investigates the relationship between behavioural variables and the onset of failure (in terms of remaining engine cycles) for simulated operational turbofan data from a NASA research project. 

The project starts with data visualisation and exploration, folowed by the development of predictive models for rotor and stator temperatures using linear regression, ensemble methods and neural networks using the Keras API.

Training data is sourced from the NASA Prognostics Center Data Repository: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan
